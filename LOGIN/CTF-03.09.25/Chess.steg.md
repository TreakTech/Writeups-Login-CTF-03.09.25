In this challenge we are given a chess PGN (Portable Game Notation):

<img width="370" height="251" alt="{1F3EE746-271D-40C3-A8DA-48B3E51737DC}" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/183b45a9-382d-448f-8065-0c581cc468ef" />

Within this PGN there is a hidden message.
By searching for "Chess Steganography" we find this site which can turn a message into a PGN, and ofcourse the same the other way around: https://incoherency.co.uk/chess-steg/

By writing the PGN into the right textbox and choosing "Unsteg without blunders" we are given the flag:
